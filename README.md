# FinalYearProject

Project on Spam Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms

Algorithms Implemented are Logistic Regresison, Decision Tree, Scikit-Learn Naive Bayes and Scikit-learn Random Forest.
These algorithms are evaluated with help of different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
